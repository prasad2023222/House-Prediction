🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as income, age, and number of rooms using a simple and interpretable machine learning model — **Linear Regression**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Predicting house prices is a common problem in real estate and finance. In this project, we use **Linear Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm, to build a predictive model trained on historical housing data. The model helps estimate the house price based on continuous and categorical variables.
